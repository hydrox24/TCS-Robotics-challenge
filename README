Codarra Robotics Challenge
==========================

This is a github repo for all the code that our 2012 Trinity team used and worked during and before the competition.
Right now it isn't very well documented, but I hope to get around to that some time.

It is all written in the NXC or "Not exactly C" language and I used the nbc compiler. The compiler (it also downloads the firmware to the brick over USB or Bluetooth) can be found [here](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/).

See the top of each file for info on how well it worked and what the program's function is.
